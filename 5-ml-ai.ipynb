    "## Model selection and architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right model and architecture is always important for any ML/AI project, but especially in image analysis. Factors to consider include the complexity of the task, the size and quality of the dataset, and the computational resources available. Common architectures include CNNs for tasks like image classification and segmentation, while more complex structures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used for image generation and enhancement. Model selection also involves choosing between different types of layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques. The architecture must be carefully designed to balance performance, accuracy, and efficiency, tailored to the specific requirements of the image analysis task."

    "## Pretrained vs custom model training \n",
    "\n",
    "One key decision in developing an ML/AI model for image analysis is whether to use a pretrained model or to train a custom model from scratch. Pretrained models, such as those available through platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch, have been trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, significantly reducing training time and computational resources. These models are particularly useful when dealing with limited data. On the other hand, custom model training allows for the creation of highly specialized models tailored to unique datasets and specific requirements, offering greater flexibility and potentially higher accuracy. However, custom training requires more data, expertise, and computational power. "
